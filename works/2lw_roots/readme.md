Purpose
==

This directory contains code to find c value of the function which can be modified in code.


Working Principle
==

This code works by finding where the function bisects X axis.

This code works with the principle that the value of the function is in between given interval \[a:b]

The code checks by multiplying the interval function values to see if it is less than 0, this signifies that the function has diferrent signs.

The function works by making interval smaller and smaller until the interval is smaller than given error that we can call it the function value.



Usage
==

To compile use:`gcc Laboratory\ work\ Nr.2.c -lm`
