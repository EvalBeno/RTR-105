Purpose
==


This directory contains the code for calculating squared cosine for the function
===

The code derived from this equation:![equation](Equation.jpg)

However if we're using this function directly you will **run out of memory** because the factorial in the denominator will make the function to have an overflow. To avoid this we can augment the each value for the sum to use an a value from the equation before like this:

![augequation](AugEq.jpg)

This equation finds the each value for the sum function to well, sum. The recursive function was found by dividing current value of a by last value of a like this:

Code for the function:

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <math.h>

void ASCII(){
    printf("\n\n--------------------------------------\n");
    printf("|           500                      |\n");
    printf("|         -------                    |\n");
    printf("|          \\         k  2k  2k-1     |\n");
    printf("|    2      \\    (-1) *x  *2         |\n");
    printf("| cos (x)=    >  -----------------   |\n");
    printf("|           /          (2k)!         |\n");
    printf("|          /                         |\n");
    printf("|         -------                    |\n");
    printf("|           k=1                      |\n");
    printf("--------------------------------------\n\n");
    }       


double Squared_Cosine(double x, int sumof);

//=================================================================
int main()
{
    double x, funcy, S;
    int const sumof=500;
    printf("\t\t\tSQUARED COSINE CALCULATOR USING TAYLOR SERIES\t\n");
    printf("Enter value of x: ");
    scanf("%lf", &x);
    funcy=cos(x)*cos(x);
    ASCII();
    S=Squared_Cosine(x,sumof);
    printf("   2\ncos (%lf)= %.15lf\n", x, funcy);
    printf("Algorihtm Value: %.15lf\n", S);
    
    return 0;
}
//==================================================================

double Squared_Cosine(double x, int sumof)
{
    int k=2;
    double a=0, S=0;
    a=-pow(x,2);
    S=S+a;
    while(k<=sumof){
        a=a*(-1)*4*pow(x,2)/(2*k*(2*k-1)); 
        S=a+S;
        if(sumof-1==k) printf("a%d=%.15lf\n", k, a);
        if(sumof==k) printf("a%d=%.15lf\n", k, a);
        k++;
        }
    S=1.0+S;
    return S;
}
```
The function Squared_Cosine() works like this:  
* Firstly the Squared_Cosine() takes two variables the number which needs to be calculated, and order of taylor polynomial
* Then the function calculates the first member to sum, and sets the k(times to run the program to 2).
* In the while loop it calculates all the members(a) and then sums up to sum(S), it runs until k reaches the sum of value.  
*In the while loop there is if() statements, those are to show penultimate value and ultimate value, these are completely unnecessary and can be removed*
* Then to correct the results since the cos^2 is shifted a bit upwards you just add 1


Using the Taylor Series method we can make a function which aproximates the squared cosine value fairly accurately as it can be seen in this graph:
===

![Graph](Graph.png)

**Thus meaning that we can use simple mathematical operations to find a value of a squared cosine.**

Benefits of using this function:
====
If you know that your values which you plug in the function will be small, then you can optimize the function to sum up less members of the âˆ‘ mathematical function. For values below 1 you can just sum up 3 taylor series polynomials significantly reducing the time that calculation takes place.

Example: Computer games need to do a lot of computations for each frame and instead of using in cos() function from c standart library you can create your own to save some time for it to calculate the squared cosine.

Usage
==

To compile use:`gcc Laboratory\ work\ Nr.1.c -lm`

After you launch the function it looks like this
==

There is also source code for the graphs made to use it:
====

To be able to use it you must have GNUPLOT installed.

Type in terminal:  
`gnuplot`  
And when you are inside GNUPLOT program type in:  
`load 'gnuplotscript.p'`
